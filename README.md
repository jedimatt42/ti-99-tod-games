There is a classic TI-99/4A game titled: Tunnels of Doom.
The skins for this game, including quest scenarios, are part of data files external to the 'command module'. 
There is a Windows program that allows for editing these data files to craft your own adventure.

The editor is not mine... I just used it to create a different scenario
