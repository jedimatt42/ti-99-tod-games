# Forest of Ruins : 
#   a Tunnels of Doom adventure.
####

This is a modified version of 'quest' 
from Texas Instruments, Tunnels of Doom. 
########################################

There are 8 relics lost in the forest that 
you are out to recover. They are leftovers
from an ancient battle between champions
from centuries past. It is said that Kra, 
a demon warrior and Gil, the hero of mankind,
battled continously in this forest for 1000
years. Eventually they mortally woulded each
other in their final battle. Their relics 
are thought to grant great power to those 
that posess them. In the very least, you
will be able to claim fame, and turn a tidy
profet selling them to the highest bidder!

That is, if you live to return from the 
Forest of Ruin!

######################################### 
The theme is similiar, but imagine, you are 
not actually going underground into dungeons, 
but rather deeper and deeper into a forest.

Your party members start out with dagger and
sling. Leather armor is available from the 
store, as well as a shield.

All other armors, weapons, and shields are
dropped as you explore. 

I've tried to do some interesting things with 
ranged weapons. For instance, there is one
that is one time use, very powerful, and drops
at mid-levels. There are others that are 
magic in nature and have unlimited use.

There is a lot of green. Get used to green.

The Hero class has been replaced with a Dwarf
class, and is available for party use.
